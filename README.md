# Router-1X3-RTL-Implementatiion-using-Verilog-and-Verification-using-UVM-Methodology

Designed and verified a Router 1x3 architecture using UVM, featuring FSM, FIFO, Synchronizer, and Register modules for efficient data flow between input and output ports. Separate read and write transaction paths were implemented for optimal data routing. Developed a comprehensive verification plan, focusing on pin-level coverage using decimal formats and assertion-based testing, ensuring the design met all functional requirements with high reliability.
